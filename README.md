# Python IO Search
Great for testing which file, folder, mod, app, etc. is causing a problem / conflict. Will iterate through all files and folders in the specified directories and move them to a temporary directory for quick and painless testing.

This quick-fire application utilizes the process of elimination to determine whether an app or file is causing conflict.

## Usage
`python {Path-To-File}/Elimination.py`

- Once run, you're prompted with basic instructions to select a source directory, and a destination directory.
- After selecting both directories, the application will move (not copy) half (rounded-down) of the files and folders from the source directory to the destination.
- As long as the user hasn't selected 'no' twice on the "does the issue persist?" question, and there is more than one file/folder in the source directory, the process repeats indefinitely.
- Once the files/folders have been eliminated down to a single option, or the user has validated that the issue no longer persists, a dialog highlighting the name and path of the file is presented, along with a dialog asking the user if they would like to restore all files/folders from the temporary folder back to the source folder.
